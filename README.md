# IEEE MIC 2024 Poster M-03-052
Here you can find additional information and animations of the poster [Cell Flow PET Simulations for Validation of Cell Tracking Algorithms](https://github.com/N-Marquardt/IEEE_MIC_2024_Poster_M-03-052/blob/029e24b6513efa23ff1a85db722d5c9fde3dbebb/IEEE%20MIC%202024%20Poster%20M-03-052.pdf) presented at the 2024 IEEE NSS MIC RTSD. 
## CeFloPS 
A preprint describing the setup and simulation steps in detail for our cell flow PET simulation model (CeFloPS) is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07709#). As illustrated in the poster, a simulation of 10 cells was carried out over a 600s period with 10ms time-steps, initiated with an injection at the left arm vein. As kinetic parameters for (immune) cells are lacking, the parameters for FDG as described by [Li et al. (2022)](https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/8/1266.abstract) have been applied to simulate the distribution of cells in organs. Consequently, the behaviour of the simulated cells deviates from that of real cells and is closer to that of FDG molecules.
